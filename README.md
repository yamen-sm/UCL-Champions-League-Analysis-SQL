# ‚öΩ Football Statistics Analysis - SQL Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **Football Statistics Analysis** using SQL, focusing on querying and analyzing match data, player performance, and team statistics. The dataset consists of four main tables:

- **teams**: Stores team details, including name, country, and coach.
- **players**: Contains player information such as team affiliation, position, goals scored, and assists.
- **matches**: Records match results, including goals scored by home and away teams.
- **goals**: Tracks individual goal details, including player, match, team, and goal type.

The SQL queries in this project demonstrate various techniques such as **joins, filtering, aggregation, subqueries, and window functions** to extract valuable insights from the football dataset.

## üîç SQL Queries Included

This project contains SQL queries that analyze various football statistics:

### **Basic Queries**
- Retrieve all players who have scored more than 5 goals.
- Show all matches where the home team scored at least 3 goals.

### **Filtering & Aggregation**
- Find teams that have never won a match.
- Retrieve the total number of goals scored by each team.

### **Joins & Subqueries**
- Find the top 3 goal scorers along with their team names.
- Retrieve all teams with at least one player having more than 10 assists.

### **Advanced Queries**
- Find players who have scored in multiple match types (Open Play, Penalty, Own Goal).
- Retrieve the team with the highest average goals per match.
- Identify players who have scored an own goal.
- Find the match with the highest total goals scored.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Set Up the Database**
   - Import the `teams`, `players`, `matches`, and `goals` tables into your SQL environment.
   - Use the following SQL statements to create the tables:

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE teams (
         team_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         team_name VARCHAR(100),
         country VARCHAR(50),
         coach VARCHAR(100)
     );

     CREATE TABLE players (
         player_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         player_name VARCHAR(100),
         team_id INT,
         position VARCHAR(50),
         goals_scored INT,
         assists INT,
         FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE matches (
         match_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         home_team_id INT,
         away_team_id INT,
         home_goals INT,
         away_goals INT,
         stadium VARCHAR(100),
         FOREIGN KEY (home_team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id),
         FOREIGN KEY (away_team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id)
     );

     CREATE TABLE goals (
         goal_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         match_id INT,
         player_id INT,
         team_id INT,
         goal_type VARCHAR(50),
         FOREIGN KEY (match_id) REFERENCES matches(match_id),
         FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id),
